## Core Research Questions

1. **Information Preservation**: What percentage of concept discriminability is retained when using only visual self-attention (attn1) vs. full adapters (attn1+attn2)?

2. **Representation Robustness**: Which representation methods are most robust to this information bottleneck? (i.e., smallest performance drop)

3. **Concept-Type Analysis**: Are certain concept categories (e.g., objects vs. styles vs. artistic concepts) more recoverable from visual-only features?

4. **Structural vs. Statistical**: Do structural methods (spectral, rank-based) outperform statistical methods (stats, distribution) in the information-limited regime?

5. **Learned vs. Hand-Crafted**: Can learned representations (contrastive, VAE) discover non-linear patterns that hand-crafted features miss?

## Highest Potential Representation Methods

### Top Tier (Implement These First)

#### 1. SimCLR-Style Contrastive Learning ⭐⭐⭐

**Why**: Explicitly learns to maximize discriminability between concepts while being invariant to noise

**Theoretical justification**: In information-limited settings, contrastive learning finds the minimal sufficient statistics for discrimination

**Expected advantage**: Should have smallest performance drop from all→visual-only because it learns what features actually matter

**Architecture**:
- Simple encoder (2-3 layer MLP) that projects weight features to embedding space
- Train with NT-Xent loss (normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy)
- Use learned embeddings for classification

**Implementation notes**:
- Positive pairs: Different layers from the same LoRA model (same concept)
- Negative pairs: Layers from different concepts
- Temperature parameter τ = 0.07 (standard)
- Projection head: MLP with hidden dim 2048, output dim 128

#### 2. Prototypical Networks / Metric Learning ⭐⭐⭐

**Why**: Learns class prototypes in embedding space, naturally suited for few-shot/limited info scenarios

**Theoretical justification**: Forces the representation to cluster same-concept weights, even with incomplete information

**Expected advantage**: Directly optimizes for your evaluation metric (classification)

**Architecture**:
- Learn embedding function f: weights → embedding space
- Represent each class by prototype: c_k = mean(f(x_i)) for all x_i in class k
- Classify by distance: argmin_k d(f(x), c_k)

**Implementation notes**:
- Distance metric: Euclidean or cosine
- Can use episodic training (sample support/query sets)
- Very interpretable results

#### 3. β-VAE (Disentangled VAE) ⭐⭐

**Why**: Learns compressed, disentangled latent representations

**Theoretical justification**: Information bottleneck in the latent space forces it to extract only the most important features

**Expected advantage**: The enforced compression might naturally align with your attn1-only information bottleneck

**Architecture**:
- Encoder: weights → latent distribution μ, σ
- Decoder: latent z → reconstructed weights
- Loss: Reconstruction + β * KL(q(z|x) || p(z))
- Classification on latent codes z

**Implementation notes**:
- β > 1 encourages disentanglement (try β = 4, 10)
- Latent dim: 128-512
- Can analyze which latent dims correspond to which concept properties

### Second Tier (Compare Against)

#### 4. Transformer with Masked Weight Modeling ⭐⭐

**Why**: BERT-style pretraining has worked well for learning representations

**Setup**:
- Treat flattened weights as sequence
- Mask random values (15% masking rate)
- Predict masked values
- Use transformer embeddings as features for classification

**Architecture**:
- Positional encodings to preserve weight structure
- Multi-head self-attention
- Pre-train on all LoRA weights (unsupervised)
- Fine-tune or use [CLS] token for classification

#### 5. Graph Neural Network ⭐

**Why**: Weight matrices have inherent structure (input→output connections)

**Setup**:
- Represent each weight matrix as bipartite graph
  - Input dim nodes, output dim nodes
  - Edge weights = matrix values
- Use GNN (e.g., GraphSAGE, GAT) to extract features

**Theoretical**: Might capture relational patterns that survive information reduction

**Challenges**:
- Computational cost for large matrices
- Need to handle varying matrix dimensions across layers

### Keep from Existing (Baselines)

- **Ensemble features**: Best hand-crafted baseline
- **Spectral features**: Tests if concept info is in eigenstructure
- **Simple stats**: Sanest baseline
- **Matrix norms**: Structural baseline
- **Distribution features**: Statistical baseline

---

## Theoretical Justification

### Information Bottleneck Perspective

Your experiment creates a natural **information bottleneck**:

- **Full setting (attn1 + attn2)**: Text cross-attention receives explicit CLIP embeddings of concept text
- **Bottleneck setting (attn1 only)**: Visual self-attention only sees image features, no explicit concept labels

**Key insight**: The visual layers MUST encode some concept information because:
1. They're fine-tuned/adapted for specific concepts
2. They process features that determine what the model generates
3. The low-rank adaptation structure captures concept-specific attention patterns

**Research question**: Which representation learning method can extract the **minimal sufficient statistics** for concept discrimination from this limited information?

### Why Learned Methods Should Win

**Hand-crafted features** (stats, spectral, etc.) assume the discriminative information is in specific properties (mean, variance, singular values)

**Learned representations** can:
- Discover **non-linear combinations** of features that hand-crafted methods miss
- Learn **task-specific** feature extractors optimized for your exact problem
- Find **invariances** (ignore irrelevant weight variations) and **equivariances** (preserve concept structure)

### Specific Hypotheses

1. **Contrastive learning** should have the smallest performance drop (all→visual-only) because it learns what features actually discriminate concepts

2. **Structural methods** (spectral, rank) might be more robust than statistical methods (stats, distribution) because concept info is encoded in **how attention operates** (eigenstructure of weight matrices) not just weight magnitudes

3. **Performance drop should vary by concept type**:
   - **Object concepts** (e.g., "dog", "car"): Large drop - heavily rely on text conditioning
   - **Style concepts** (e.g., "watercolor", "cyberpunk"): Small drop - encoded more in visual processing
   - **Artistic concepts**: Medium drop

## Concrete Experimental Plan

### Phase 1: Baseline Establishment

**Goal**: Establish how much information is lost when removing text layers

**Tasks**:
- Run all existing representations on attn1+attn2 (full)
- Run all existing representations on attn1 only (visual-only)

- Identify which hand-crafted methods are most robust

**Metrics to track**:
- Test accuracy (primary)
- Test F1-score (for imbalanced classes)

2. Train encoder:
   ```
   encoder: Raw weight features → Embedding (dim 128-512)

   decoder: z ~ N(μ, σ) → reconstructed weights
   ```

2. Train with β-VAE loss:
   ```
   L = Reconstruction_loss + β * KL(q(z|x) || N(0,I))
   ```

3. Extract latent codes for classification

4. Train simple classifier on latent codes

5. Evaluate on both settings

**Hyperparameters to tune**:

## Key Paper Narrative

**The Story**:

> "Diffusion model adapters (LoRA) are widely used to teach models new concepts, but we don't understand HOW they encode these concepts. We investigate this by creating an information bottleneck: we remove the text cross-attention layers (attn2) and ask whether we can still discriminate concepts using ONLY visual self-attention layers (attn1).

> We find that hand-crafted feature representations (statistics, spectral analysis) suffer significant performance drops when text information is removed. However, learned representations—particularly contrastive learning and metric learning—are much more robust to this information bottleneck.

> This reveals two insights: (1) Visual self-attention layers encode substantial concept information, even without text conditioning, and (2) Learned representations that explicitly optimize for discriminability can extract this information far better than hand-crafted features that assume what matters.

> Our work opens the door to better understanding of how diffusion adapters work, and suggests that learned weight-space representations could enable new applications like efficient concept classification without needing full adapter evaluation."

**Why This is Compelling**:
- Clear problem (understanding concept encoding)
- Creative experimental design (ablation as information bottleneck)
- Strong empirical results (learned > hand-crafted)
- Theoretical grounding (information theory, contrastive learning)
- Practical implications (model compression, concept classification)
